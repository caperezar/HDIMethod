# Harmonic Density Interpolation (HDI) method for high-order evaluation of Laplace layer potentials in 3D
This project is a Matlab implementation of the HDI method for the high-order evaluation of the Laplace layer potential and integral operators in three-spatial dimensions. The HDI method is simple but effective numerical procedure for the numerical evaluation of singular and nearly singular Laplace boundary integral operators and layer potentials in three spatial dimensions. The method relies on the use of Green?s third identity and local Taylor interpolations of density functions in terms of harmonic polynomials. This procedure effectively regularizes the singularities present in boundary integral operators and layer potentials and recasts the latter in terms of integrands that are continuous or even more regular, depending on the order of singularity subtraction. The resulting boundary integrals can then be easily, accurately, and inexpensively evaluated by means of standard quadrature rules, which in this particular implementation corresponds to first Fej\'er quadrature rule to integrate over surfaces given as unions of non-overlapping quadrilateral patches) in three-dimensions.
